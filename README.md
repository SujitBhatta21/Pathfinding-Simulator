# A* Pathfinding Simulator

## Overview

This project is an A* pathfinding simulator implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The simulator allows users to visualize and explore the A* pathfinding algorithm in a grid-based environment. Users can set start and end points, block nodes, and observe how the algorithm finds the optimal path.

## Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: The simulator provides an interactive user interface with buttons for setting the start and end points, blocking nodes, and initiating the pathfinding simulation.

- **Dynamic Grid**: Users can dynamically adjust the grid size to explore different scenarios, providing flexibility in testing the A* algorithm's behavior.

- **Real-time Visualization**: The simulator provides real-time visualization of the A* algorithm's progress, helping users understand how the algorithm explores the grid to find the optimal path.

## How to Use

1. **Introduction Screen**: Click "Let's Go!!!" to navigate to the user input screen.

2. **User Input Screen**: Enter the desired grid size and click "ENTER" to proceed to the play screen.

3. **Play Screen**: Set the start and end points, block nodes, and use the "Start the Simulator" button to initiate the A* pathfinding simulation.

4. **Simulation Results**: Once the simulation is complete, the optimal path will be highlighted in blue.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Running the Simulator

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Pygame using `pip install pygame`.
3. Run the script using `python filename.py`.
